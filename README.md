# My Personal Project

## Project Proposal:
The goal of this project is to make a video game that is 
fun and easy to play. My current idea is to make a 2D 
endless shooter, which include the following elements:

- different types of enemies
- money (from defeating enemies and finding treasure 
chests)
- experience (from defeating enemies, increases basic 
stats)
- different items (can be stored or removed from inventory)
- shop (to buy/upgrade items)
- scaling (the longer you play, the harder the game 
gets)
- endless maze as the map
- player movement within the map

The last 2 elements may not be feasible to implement. 
If this is the case, I will remove player movement
and level generation, and focus mainly on the aiming
aspect of the game. 

This project is of interest to me because I've only ever
played video games, and never had the chance to make one.
This project is the perfect opportunity to give it a go. 
I'm hoping that the project turns out to be fun, so anyone
can enjoy it.
